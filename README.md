# Defense-of-Hakurei-Shrine
Game Last updated: May 15, 2017
An HTML5 Canvas project made when I was a high school kid. This is a fan-made Touhou project game using Canvas.
Images in this game belong to Team Shanghai Alice.

The game is based on pure JavaScript w/ canvas. No external library included.

Implementation will be reorganized in the future.
